# Follow Bot

## Summary
This project implements algorithms for a turtlebot to follow yellow track and action differently at intersections based on visual information. It is simulated in a Gazebo simylator. Following are the 4 maps this project works on. 

### Map 1:
- Follow the yellow line

### Map 2:
- follow the yellow track when not at an intersection
- turn left at the intersection with a green marker
- turn right at the intersection with a blue marker
- stop exactly on the red marker

### Map 3:
- follow the yellow track when not at an intersection
- turn left at the intersection with a triangle marker pointing left 
- turn right at the intersection with a triangle marker pointing right 
- stop exactly on the star marker

### Map 4: 
- Same as Map 3 but there is only yellow

## Run the script
To set up the environment, for four maps, this command needs to be run first. 
```
roscore
```
To set up the environment of map 1, open a new terminal
```
roslaunch followbot launch.launch
```

To run the code for map 1, open another terminal
```
python follower.py
```

To set up the environment of map 2, open a new terminal
```
ROBOT_INITIAL_POSE="-x -2.85 -y -0.27 -Y 1.53" roslaunch followbot launch.launch world_file:=color.world
```

To run the code for map 2, open another terminal
```
python follower_part2.py
```

To set up the environment of map 3, open a new terminal
```
ROBOT_INITIAL_POSE="-x -2.85 -y -0.27 -Y 1.53" roslaunch followbot launch.launch world_file:=shape.world
```

To run the code for map 3, open another terminal
```
python follower_part3.py
```

To set up the environment of map 4, open a new terminal
```
ROBOT_INITIAL_POSE="-x -2.85 -y -0.27 -Y 1.53" roslaunch followbot launch.launch world_file:=extra.world
```

To run the code for map 4, open another terminal
```
python follower_part4.py
```

### Brief Description of Methods
* All methods should be self-explained.

### Explanation of logic: 
1. follower.py is the basic version for following yellow mark lines. 
2. follower_part2.py added green, blue and red masks for detecting these colors from input image, and make movements accordingly. 
3. follower_part3.py utilized template matching supported by opencv to detect triangles and star. Templates were pre generated by parser.py and stored in the template folder.
4. follower_part4.py is different from part 3 as there is no red color to tell the robot that there is a sign ahead, so template matching keeps going when follower_part4.py runs. In addition to make robot more stable, the view of the robot is limited to the center of the input image both width and height.
