# Robotics Related Algorithms

## Summary
This repo contains several interesting projects which implement robotic related algorithms. Problems we are trying to solve in this repo can be divided into two catogories. The first problem is path planing and the other is robotic movements.
- Path planning algorithms
    - [Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)](https://github.com/YiyangQian/W4733-Robotics/tree/master/RRT)
    - [Bi-directional RRT](https://github.com/YiyangQian/W4733-Robotics/tree/master/BiDirectionalRRT)
    - [Visibility Graph (Vgraph)](https://github.com/YiyangQian/W4733-Robotics/tree/master/Vgraph)
    - [Bug 2](https://github.com/YiyangQian/W4733-Robotics/tree/master/Bug2PathPlanning) 
- Robot movement
    - [FollowBot](https://github.com/YiyangQian/W4733-Robotics/tree/master/FollowBot)
    - [Translation and Rotation](https://github.com/YiyangQian/W4733-Robotics/tree/master/TranslationAndRotation)
